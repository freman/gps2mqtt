# GPS2MQTT

Get your GPS data from various cheap GPS trackers directly (well, via MQTT) into HomeAssistant without the massive load of JAVA or third party hosting.

Inspired by a desire to leave [Traccar](https://traccar.org) which, don't get me wrong is a wonderful application, just overkill for simply triggering on GPS events.

I don't currently have the desire to implement the more advance features of protocols (some support writing back to the device) but this may change in future.

## Supported Protocols

* watch
